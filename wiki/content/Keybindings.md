Keybindings
===

Most menu items also have a hotkey for triggering them. This hotkey is noted down next to the menu label. However, some functions of the program do not have corresponding menu entries. The following tables document these functionalities and their respective hotkeys.

Customizing hotkeys
===================

At this time, MComix unfortunately does not have an unified keybinding editor. Due to implementation issues, the configuration is split over two files - `keybindings-gtk.rc` for menu shortcuts, and `keybindings.conf` for all other hotkeys. Do not edit these files while MComix is still running, as your changes will be overwritten when the program is closed.

For hotkeys that can be reached with a menu entry, such as "File -> Open", changing the associated keybinding is easy: Hover the mouse over the menu and press the desired key or key combination. The text should instantly update to reflect the changes to the binding.
