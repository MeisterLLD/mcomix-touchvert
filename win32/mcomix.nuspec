    <description># Summary
MComix is a user-friendly, customizable image viewer. It is specifically designed to handle comic books (both Western comics and manga) and supports a variety of container formats (including CBR, CBZ, CB7, CBT, LHA and PDF). It is written in Python using GTK+ through the PyGTK bindings, and runs on both Linux and Windows.

MComix is a fork of the [Comix project](https://comix.sourceforge.net), and aims to add bug fixes and stability improvements after Comix development came to a halt in late 2009.

# Features
* Reads most common image formats, as well as PDF, ZIP, RAR, 7Z and LHA archives directly.
* Fullscreen mode, double-page mode, fit image to window width, height or both.
* Smart scrolling for easier reading (just hit the space bar a few times and see how it works)
* Manga mode (for right-to-left comic books)
* Bookmark pages and add books to the library.</description>
