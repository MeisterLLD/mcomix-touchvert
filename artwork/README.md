### Original MComix icon artwork

`mcomix-large.png` is a high-resolution image of the original MComix icon,
retained for its historical significance and for reference.

### 2023 artwork update

`mcomix_icon_artwork.svg` is the Inkscape source file
for an updated (July 2023) version of the icon,
due to the original vector sources having been lost over time.
The art was recreated in fully vector form,
starting from the `mcomix-large.png` artwork as a template.
The new vector artwork is faithful to the original to a point,
but addresses several errors discernible in the previous artwork
(if only when viewing the image's individual pixels at full scale).

`/mcomix/images/mcomix.svg` is the optimized MComix SVG icon,
exported from `mcomix_icon_artwork.svg`.
It is the source file for all rendered bitmap versions of the icon.
(Icon bitmaps can be found in `/mcomix/images/mcomix.ico`,
`/mcomix/images/mcomix.png`,
and the `mcomix.png` file inside each of the size-named directories
under `/mcomix/images/`. (`16x16`, `32x32`, etc.)
